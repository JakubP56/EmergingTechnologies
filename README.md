Welcome to my repository for the Emerging Technologies module at ATU Galway. In this repository you can find two jupyter notebooks that I completed throughout the course of the module. The notebooks are listed below.

## [Tasks notebook](/tasks.ipynb)
This notebook contains tasks that were assigned to me throughout the semester:  
- ### The Collatz Conjecture
    In this task I am exploring the Collatz Conjecture, which is a widely known, unsolved mathematical problem.
- ### Approximating Square Roots with Newton's Method
    Using Newton's Method to calculate square roots in Python.
- ### Boolean Algebra: Calculating Possible Functions from Input Bits
    Finding all possible functions taking four bits as input and outputting a single bit.
- ### Matrix Multiplication on Two Rectangular Lists 
    Performing Matrix Multiplication in Python using two different approaches.
