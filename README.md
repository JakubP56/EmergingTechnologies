# Emerging Technologies

Welcome to my repository for the Emerging Technologies module at ATU Galway. In this repository you can find two jupyter notebooks that I completed throughout the course of the module. The notebooks are listed below.

## [Tasks notebook](/tasks.ipynb)
This notebook contains tasks that were assigned to me throughout the semester:  
- ### The Collatz Conjecture
    In this task I am exploring the Collatz Conjecture, which is a widely known, unsolved mathematical problem.
- ### Approximating Square Roots with Newton's Method
    Using Newton's Method to calculate square roots in Python.
- ### Boolean Algebra: Calculating Possible Functions from Input Bits
    Finding all possible functions taking four bits as input and outputting a single bit.
- ### Matrix Multiplication on Two Rectangular Lists 
    Performing Matrix Multiplication in Python using two different approaches.

## [Deutsch's Algorithm notebook](/project.ipynb)

This is a notebook containing my research on Deutsch's Algorithm, where I give an introduction to Quantum Computing, explain Deutsch's Algorithm and implement the algorithm in Qiskit.

## Running the Notebooks

In order to run the notebooks in this repository, firstly close the repository onto your computer as follows:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JakubP56/EmergingTechnologies
```

Next, Install the required packages. While creating this notebook, I used Anaconda as my package manager. If not already installed,
you can download Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download.

To install Jupyter:

```bash
    conda install -c anaconda jupyter
```

To install the Qiskit package:

```bash
    pip install qiskit
```
To install the Numpy package:

```bash
    pip install numpy
```
    
Now that the necessary software is installed, navigate to the repository

```bash 
    cd EmergingTechnologies
```  
From here, you can finally run the Jupyter Notebook as follows:

```bash 
    jupyter notebook
```
