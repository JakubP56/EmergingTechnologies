    "## **What is Quantum Computing and How does it compare to Classical Computers?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Quantum computing is a rapidly-emerging technology that harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems too complex for classical computers.\"[1] \n",

    "### *Classical Computers*\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical Computers like a laptop process information using bits. A bit can be taught of as a switch with two states: 0 and 1, which in simple terms means off or on. These bits are used to represent all the calculations in a classical computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Quantum Computers*\n",
    "\n",
    "In Quantum Computers, calculations are done using quantum bits(qubits). These qubits can be in any hybrid position of 0 and 1, meaning they can either be 0 or 1, or a combination of both. This is known as superposition. Superposition is a quantum concept that allows qubits to exist in multiple states simultaneously. This concept allows quantum computers to perform certain computations more efficiently.[2]\n",
