    "## **What is Quantum Computing and How does it compare to Classical Computers?**\n",

    "\"Quantum computing is a rapidly-emerging technology that harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems too complex for classical computers.\"[1] \n",
    "\n",
    "### *Classical Computers*\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical Computers like a laptop process information using bits. A bit can be taught of as a switch with two states: 0 and 1, which in simple terms means off or on. These bits are used to represent all the calculations in a classical computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Quantum Computers*\n",
    "\n",
    "In Quantum Computers, calculations are done using quantum bits(qubits). These qubits can be in any hybrid position of 0 and 1, meaning they can either be 0 or 1, or a combination of both. This is known as superposition. Superposition is a quantum concept that allows qubits to exist in multiple states simultaneously. This concept allows quantum computers to perform certain computations more efficiently.[2]\n",

    "Deutsch's Algorithm was proposed by David Deutsch in 1985 in order to demonstrate the computational speedup of quantum computers compared to classical computer for certain tasks. It indicates that quantum computers could be more powerful than classical computers. It is one of the earliest algorithms to explore this idea. The algorithm focuses on solving the oracle problem.\n",
